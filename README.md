Build From Source

Youâ€™ll need the .NETÂ 9 SDK.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jimmy-Tollett/Vault.git
cd Vault
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

To create a single-file executable for any platform:

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true \
  /p:PublishSingleFile=true /p:PublishTrimmed=true
```

Replace win-x64 with linux-x64, osx-x64, etc. as needed.
